# Always in
- If you were forced to enter the market, your choice is always in direction (infer from context)
- Whenever you know the always in direction, you have to enter the trade in that direction immediately, even if you trade a small position.
- If you have to put stop far away, trade small appropriately
- Better trade small than missing opportunity if you've determined always in direction

# Gap
Gap = Fair Value Gap.
Three candles of same directions
