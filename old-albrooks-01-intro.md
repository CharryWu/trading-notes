- Don't use charts with more than 20 ticks per hour, unless you want to do manual high frequency trading. High quality Decision takes time to make
- Don't overtrade. If you become consistently profitable, simply increase position size.

- Market is interweaved by trading ranges and trends. Trends are transitions between trading ranges; while trading ranges are transitions between trends. Trading ranges are pauses in trends, while trends are transitions between trading range (market decides to move to another price). Every subportion of the chart, every bar is either a trend or trading range.

- Short trading ranges amid trend will likely to resume within 1-20 bars, long trading ranges amid trend pauses the momentum, the breakout could be continuation or reversal

- Pullback, pause in trends = trading range on smaller time frame; all trading ranges are pullbacks on higher timeframes
- Channel = weak trend
- All trends begin with a (series of) spike, a long kandlestick moving in the direction of the trend

- Usually channel begins with some kind of pullbacks

**If you decide there's breakout of a trend, you have to get long, don't wait for pullback to get long because pullback may never happen**

**If you decide there's a trading range, you buy low and sell high. Don't hold, because market will invariably comes to your entry point**
