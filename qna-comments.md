a double top is a failed second attempt to go up while a double bottom is a failed second attempt to go down.
a two leg movement is two attempts to go up or down.

in a way you have to get used to thinking in a certain way-practice it with historical charts.

it is as Al says a fairly easy way to trade.....if not anything, it will keep you from making bad trades or cutting losses early, which is more than half the battle in trading!


i think it is ok not to bother whether it is H1 OR H2 OR H3 but to note that an attempt as been made by the market to go in that direction....if it does NOT continue in that direction then it is highly likely , it will go in the opposite direction.
