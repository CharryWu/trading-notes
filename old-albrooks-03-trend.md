# Trend
A trend can be just one bar, or entire graph

## bull trend
- higher high and lows
- contained in a rising channel
- bottom of channel = bull trend

## Bear trend
- Lower high and lows
-

## trend & trading ranges
- Every bar is either a trend bar or trading range bar
    - trend bar: big body, small tails
    - trading range bar: small body, big tails
    - Context matters: Small body in strong trend is more of a trend bar; Big body in sideways (lots of overlapping bars and big tails & reversals) is a trading range bar
- Within a big trend, there's small trading ranges
    - 5 min chart leg has trend on 1,2 min chart
- Within a trading range, there's small trend
    - In a 1 hr chart rising trend, you can see pullbacks so large that's basically trading ranges
- If you see both buy & sell pattern, market is in trading range
- Confusion is hallmark of trading ranges. If you see currently there's a good reason to buy, and also see a good reason to sell, you're facing trading ranges
- If you see a clear trend, take trade in the direction of trend, swing part or all your position
    - Let your profits grow and do not exit too early

- When you believe market is in trading range, trade opposite of current trend
    - Buy low, sell high, scalp (set profit target and exit when reached)
    - Bear spike 80% will fail to make low and reverse

**Always use protective stops**
- For ALL trades, always use stops, put the stop ahead

## Beginner's fault vs. Institutional
- Beginners wait for pullbacks, want a smaller stop to have less risk
- Anxious that one never comes
- missing huge trend, fearful of big loss from wide stop

- If market is going up, institutions are buying relentlessly
- To make money  you have to copy institutions
- It's okay if stops are far away, buy small and don't miss opportunity

## Tails
- Every tail could be a strong trend body; they are failed breakout attempt

## Gap
- Breakout gap, measuring gap, exhaustion gap
- Every gap is a trend bar; they're functionally the same
