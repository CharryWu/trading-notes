# Signal bar works with context to determine your buy point
## Setup = signal bar + context
## Bull signal bar vs. bear
- Bull signal bar closes 50% above, has short/little tail above and long tail below;
- Bear signal bar vice verca
## In a strong trend, you don't need strong signal bar to enter a trade
- In strong trend, signal bar in the direction of trend are often weak; even if you have strong signal bar in opposite direction, don't trade against trend
- Don't wait for perfect signal, just enter at the market; If you take perfect signal bar, you don't take any trade
## In a weak trend, you need strong signal bar to enter a trade
- In a weak setup (weak signal bar and/or weak context), you can enter at
    - Strong breakout
    - Always in reversal
    - 2nd entry
        - You may trade small on first signal (half or quarter position size)
            - if stopped out on first entry, wait for second signal, enter with normal position size (double 1st entry size)
            - use wide stop on first entry
            - if stopped twice, don't take 3rd signal (you're fighting a strong trend)

## Wide stop for entry during weak trend (less certain), smaller stop when market goes in your way (certain)
    - Use tighter stop when market goes in your way
    - Actual risk is less than initial risk, set your profit target based on the stop of actual risk
## Trading ranges probably need two strong signal bar to confirm direction
## weak trend & weak signal bar = wait for breakout to enter trade
    - Only buy above strong bull signal bar
    - Only sell below strong bear signal bar
