This is an excellent observation. If you see multiple **H1s** labeled in a chart sequence (rather than an H1 followed by an H2), it typically signifies a **Count Reset** due to a strong trend.

In Al Brooks' methodology, the "count" (H1, H2, H3) is not permanent; it resets based on the market's success.

### 1\. The "Reset" Rule

The bar count resets to zero as soon as the trend **resumes successfully**.

  * **Scenario:** You have a Bull Trend. The price pulls back (H1). The price then rallies and breaks above the previous trend high (making a **New High**).
  * **The Result:** The prior H1 "did its job." It worked. The next time the market pulls back, you start counting from 1 again.

Therefore, a very strong trend (like a "Small Pullback Bull Trend") will often look like a series of H1s:
`Trend -> H1 -> New High -> H1 -> New High -> H1`

**Analogy: Climbing a Ladder**

  * You step up (Trend), pause to catch your breath (H1), and then climb higher (New High).
  * When you pause again, it is a *fresh* pause. You don't say "this is my second pause relative to the ground"; you treat it as a new event.

### 2\. When does it become an H2?

You only move to **H2** if the H1 **fails** to make a new high.

  * **Scenario:** Price pulls back (H1). You buy. The price tries to go up but hits resistance and **cannot make a new high**. It then turns back down.
  * **The Result:** The H1 failed to restart the trend. The *next* reversal attempt is now the **H2** (the second attempt).

### 3\. Visual Breakdown

Here is a text-based logic flow to visualize the difference:

**Scenario A: Series of H1s (Strong Trend)**

```text
      (New High)      (New High)
          /               /
         /               /
(H1 Buy)/       (H1 Buy)/
   \   /           \   /
    \ /             \ /
(Trend)           (Trend)
```

*Note: The count resets because the price made a New High between the setups.*

**Scenario B: H1 leading to H2 (Complex Pullback)**

```text
      (No New High - Stalls)
          /  \
         /    \
(H1 Buy)/      \
   \   /        \
    \ /          \
(Trend)           (H2 Buy - The Real Entry)
                       \    /
                        \  /
                         \/
```

*Note: The count continues to 2 because the price failed to break out.*

### ⚠️ A Note on AI Generated Charts

If the image I generated shows two "H1" labels right next to each other *without* a new high in between, that is likely an **artifact (error)** of the AI image generation. AI models sometimes struggle with consistent text labeling on charts.

In strict Price Action theory:

  * **New High = Reset to H1**
  * **No New High = Continue to H2**

**Hierarchy Position:**
`Bar Counting -> Trend Resumption -> The Count Reset Rule`

**Would you like me to diagram the "Wedge" pattern (H3)? That is what happens when the H1 and H2 both fail.**
